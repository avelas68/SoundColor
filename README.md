Abstract:<br>
	For this project Me along with two other classmates decided to write a program using P5JS for people to visually see the amplitude peaks of a song that is being played on the website. We included a ‘pause’ button to pause the current song playing and a ‘change song’ button that would be able to change to the next song. The website showcased amplitude peaks that were both high and low, which was achieved by ellipses appearing onto the screen. An ellipse with a smaller diameter would appear if the peak amplitude was low and an ellipse with a much bigger diameter would appear if the peak amplitude was high. The smaller ellipses also had lighter colors associated with them and the bigger ellipses had more dark colors to them.<br>
Methods:<br>
	Firstly, we  had to choose songs with good beats to add to our program via array. We then changed the pointer of the current song that was being played to be pointing at a different song once the user clicked on ‘Change Song’. This was accomplished by the use of the mod and .length functions of Javascript. We also used .play() and .pause() functions to play and pause the corresponding songs.  The way we were able to grab the song’s amplitude peaks was the function amplitude.getLevel(). The amplitude.getLevel() function was able to help us sort out which amplitude peaks we wanted for a specific color group and how big we wanted their ellipse to be. The sorting was done by if statements that we hardcoded to sort the amplitudes.<br>
Findings:<br>
	This project taught me a lot about the sound portions of P5JS that I had not worked with before. In order for me to have sorted the corresponding amplitudes with one another I had to listen to different songs with our program running  while using Inspect on the console to see what types of amplitudes were being printed out. After listening to a wide variety of music I was able to divide the levels of amplitude that were being printed onto the console into five groups. Each group had a different level of peak amplitude. After I was able to figure out how peak amplitudes were being calculated with P5JS the rest was pretty simple and fun for me and my classmates to create.<br>
